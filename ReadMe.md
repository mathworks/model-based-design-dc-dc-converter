# Model-Based Design for a SEPIC
In this reference example we will use a SEPIC circuit topology to show how to model and simulate a DC-DC converter that powers LED lights.  Using Simulink and Simscape Electrical, you can analyze, develop, simulate, and implement a controller that maintains desired output voltage in the presence of input voltage variations and load changes to achieve fast and stable response. The demonstration will includes generating embedded code from the control algorithms suitable for implementing on a microcontroller. Part of this example can be executed without hardware.

## Branches and project structures
Since I'm not developing directly on github, but on our internal gitlab, I am pushing branches updated to new releases instead of updating the master branch. This is due to how I need to export the project using a public facing template, which erase history.
To fork this project, please use the branch marked with the relevant releases, or use the Releases. To simply access the content, even better to do it from the File Exchange link below, or search for it using the Add-On from within MATLAB.

<!--
Use the <exclude> tag to exclude files or folders.Excluded files are relative to the location of this exclude.xml file.  Either forward or backward slashes can be used as file separators.
Examples:
	<exclude>foo.m</exclude> foo.m in same folder as exclude.xml
	<exclude>myfiles/foo.m</exclude> foo.m in myfiles directory at same level as exclude.xml
	<exclude>myfiles</exclude> myfiles directory
The following are excluded automatically:
* This exclude.xml file
* ReadMe.md (case-insensitive)
* "Internal" folders (case-insensitive)
* WebEx Poll files (anything with *.atp extension)
* All git files (.git, .gitmodules, etc.)
